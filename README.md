# LightDB

In this project assignment, you will implement a lightweight database management system
called LightDB. The assignment goals are threefold:
* to teach you how to translate from SQL queries to relational algebra query plans,
* to familiarize you with the iterator model for relational operator evaluation, and
* to build naive implementations for the most common operators (selection, projection, join, sort).
