# LightDB

In this project assignment, I implemenedt a lightweight database management system
called LightDB. Goals for this project are threefold:
* to learn how to translate from SQL queries to relational algebra query plans,
* to familiarize with the iterator model for relational operator evaluation, and
* to build naive implementations for the most common operators (selection, projection, join, sort).
